The Quiz App is a simple JavaScript application that presents multiple-choice questions to the user. It stores the questions in an array, each containing the question text, options, and the correct answer. The app dynamically displays questions and their corresponding options. Upon selecting an answer, the app checks whether it’s correct and updates the score. After answering all questions, the app displays the user’s final score. The interface is styled using CSS to make it modern and interactive, with hover effects on options and buttons. The app is responsive, ensuring usability across devices. The user progresses through the quiz by clicking the "Next Question" button. It uses JavaScript functions to handle user interactions, question display, and result calculation.
